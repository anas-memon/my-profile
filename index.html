        <p>
          Anas is passionate about, and engaged in social entrepreneurship, trading in financial markets, continental philosophy, and the pinnacle of sports: football.

        <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          Anas delved into his professional career at 16, with an internship in Re-insurance. Since then, he has interned in Data Analysis and Investment Banking, whilst winning nation-wide awards from Liv Bank. Anas held a year-long post as the writer for an esteemed admissions group, drafting admissions essays for undergraduate and master's students aspiring to travel worldwide. Additionally, and most importantly, his most rewarding experience was the conception of an NPA with his friends at the age of 15. This organization ran smoothly for 4 years, and financed the education of underprivileged children and maintanence of labor camps in 'third-world' countries.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
         In the short-term, I aim to procure an intership in the financial world over the summer, to enhance my understanding of financial derivatives and asset management. 

         I also hope to take a short vacation if the spread of COVID is contained.
